# 🍫 Simply Chocolate - Landing Page

Hi! This is a frontend training project I built during my free time.  
It’s a responsive landing page based on a [Figma design](<https://www.figma.com/design/K0wv6eLQWikKAl088dVECq/Simply-Chocolate-(Copy)-(Copy)-(Copy)?node-id=609-1205&m=dev>), created to practice layout building and improve my coding skills.

## 🚀 What I learned

Since I’m still learning frontend development, **this project was practice in everything** — layout building, responsiveness, animations, and clean code structure.

There were some small challenges along the way, but I managed to solve them all and learned a lot from the process.  
I'm especially proud of the **responsive layout** and the neat codebase.

## ✨ What's next?

I plan to improve the project by adding more advanced animations as I grow my frontend skills.  
Stay tuned! 😉
